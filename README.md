# Description

The aim of this project is to provide a tool for which players of the game Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition can create combat encounters swiftly and with less confusion. Rather than have them go through the current “CR” (Challenge Rating) rating system, we aim to build a website for users to tailor encounters to their needs: sorting by monster types, themes, and a difficulty level that scales to their DnD party (using an algorithm that scales better than CR), etc. This project will initially take the form of a website with hopes for developing an app in the future.
We intend to make our project compatible with this open-source website to create and export DnD monsters as a special .monster file. This will allow users to edit the monster suggestions they are given, should they choose to export it as a .monster file from our program.

# Stack

For the back end we are using Python. The front end stack is currently undecided but at a minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used.
Goals
Creating an algorithm to suggest monsters given input data
Create a working parser for .monster type files in order to accept homebrew monsters and display said data.
Importing a set of default D&D monster data into the system.
Allowing players to export monster data as .monster type files, and encounter data as .encounter files
Creating a sort algorithm for the most effective sorting and filtering
Have a website made that contains a front-end and displays info from the back-end
Have a login system that saves user data across multiple visits

# Milestones

Note: we have split team members into the back end (making the code for the monster algorithms) and the front end (making the website)
