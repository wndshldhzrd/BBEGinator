REMAINING CHANGES LEFT:

shieldbonus: see what armor is and get it from there?? only exists if "shield" is specified under armor_desc?
deal with nat armor bonus at some point probably

specialdamage formatting is wrong (example of what something looks like: [{"name":"amogus","note":" (Immune)","type":"i"}. not just 'specialdamage': 'acid'.) [have to figure out if it's resistant/immune/vulnerable]   (also acid might be a damagetype rather than specialdamage)

skills should be "skills":[{"name":"history","stat":"int","note":" (ex)"}, ] currently 'skills': {'perception': 11, 'stealth': 7}
