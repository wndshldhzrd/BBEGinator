Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source.

They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food.

Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.  \nApex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.  \n_**Born to Darkness.**_ Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels, or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight entirely.  \nCave dragon coloration darkens with age, but it always provides good camouflage against stone: white like limestone, yellow, muddy brown, then black at adult and older categories. Mature adult and old cave dragons sometimes fade to gray again.  \n_**Ravenous Marauders.**_ Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat absolutely everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. What alliances they do make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically end in failure. Cave dragons do form alliances with derro or drow, joining them in battle against the darakhul, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.  \n_**A Hard Life.**_ Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. A few climb to the surface to feed, but their sensitivity to sunlight, earthbound movement, and lack of sight leave them at a terrible disadvantage.  \n\n## A Cave Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nLabyrinthine systems of tunnels, caverns, and chasms make up the world of cave dragons. They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.  \nLarge vertical chimneys, just big enough to contain the beasts, make preferred ambush sites for young cave dragons. Their ruff spikes hold them in position until prey passes beneath.  \nDue to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon\u2019s hoard may consist largely of food sources: colonies of bats, enormous beetles, carcasses in various states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn\u2019t immediately devour.  \nCave dragons are especially fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, sorted or arranged like artful ossuaries.  \nCave dragons have no permanent society. They gather occasionally to mate and to protect their eggs at certain spawning grounds. Large vertical chimneys are popular nesting sites. There, the oldest cave dragons also retreat to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.\n* A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.\n* The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon.

Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._  \nThe flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. \u201cMay you be the fire\u2019s plaything\u201d is a curse often used by the foolish.  \n_**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure\u2014direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler\u2019s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.  \n_**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon\u2019s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.  \n_**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.  \nNothing is safe from a flame dragon\u2019s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon\u2019s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon\u2019s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.  \n\n## Flame Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nFlame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.  \nMany of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n* The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can\u2019t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.\n* A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary flame dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.\n* Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.\n* Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon\u2019s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they\u2019re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days.

Its large fins double as wings._  \n**Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.  \nDespite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.  \n**Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon\u2019s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.  \n**Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon\u2019s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.  \n\n## Sea Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nSea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.  \nWhatever the place, it\u2019s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.  \nThe sky surrounding a sea dragon\u2019s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall\u2019s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary sea dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.\n* Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.\n* Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.", "name": "Adult Sea Dragon", "size": "Huge", "type": "Dragon", "subtype": "", "group": null, "alignment": "neutral evil", "armor_class": 19, "armor_desc": "natural armor", "hit_points": 225, "hit_dice": "18d12+108", "speed": {"walk": 40, "fly": 80, "swim": 60}, "strength": 25, "dexterity": 10, "constitution": 23, "intelligence": 17, "wisdom": 15, "charisma": 19, "strength_save": null, "dexterity_save": 5, "constitution_save": 11, "intelligence_save": null, "wisdom_save": 7, "charisma_save": 9, "perception": 12, "skills": {"perception": 12, "stealth": 5}, "damage_vulnerabilities": "", "damage_resistances": "", "damage_immunities": "cold", "condition_immunities": "", "senses": "blindsight 60ft, darkvision 120ft, passive Perception 22", "languages": "Common, Draconic", "challenge_rating": "16", "cr": 16.0, "actions": [{"name": "Multiattack", "desc": "The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon\u2019s body._  \n**Children of the Stars.** Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world, wanderers between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.  \n**Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.  \n**Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.  \n\n## A Void Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nThe true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon\u2019s lair rests in the great void of space.  \nWhen a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.  \nIf fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n* The Void briefly overlaps the dragon\u2019s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary void dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.\n* Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can\u2019t create bright light in this area.\n* Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon\u2019s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.", "name": "Adult Void Dragon", "size": "Huge", "type": "Dragon", "subtype": "", "group": null, "alignment": "chaotic neutral", "armor_class": 19, "armor_desc": "natural armor", "hit_points": 229, "hit_dice": "17d12+119", "speed": {"hover": true, "walk": 40, "fly": 80}, "strength": 24, "dexterity": 10, "constitution": 25, "intelligence": 16, "wisdom": 13, "charisma": 21, "strength_save": null, "dexterity_save": 5, "constitution_save": 12, "intelligence_save": null, "wisdom_save": 6, "charisma_save": 10, "perception": 11, "skills": {"arcana": 13, "history": 13, "perception": 11, "persuasion": 10, "stealth": 5}, "damage_vulnerabilities": "", "damage_resistances": "", "damage_immunities": "cold", "condition_immunities": "charmed, frightened", "senses": "blindsight 60ft, darkvision 120ft, passive Perception 21", "languages": "Common, Draconic, Void Speech", "challenge_rating": "14", "cr": 14.0, "actions": [{"name": "Multiattack", "desc": "The dragon can use its Aura of Madness.

Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.  \n_**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it\u2019s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.  \n_**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.  \n_**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.  \nWind dragons\u2019 hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic items\u2014often quite portable.  \n\n## Wind Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nWind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can\u2019t pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.\n* Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair\u2019s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n* A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius.
